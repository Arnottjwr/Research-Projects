## A Mathematical Analysis of the Electric Guitar
Undergraduate Dissertation written at the the University of St Andrews under supervision from Dr Andrew Wright during the 2023-24 academic year.

**Abstract:**
*The electric guitar is an ideal vessel for mathematical study. Its function mirrors many classical mathematical topics and consequently it acts as an effective bridge between theoretical applied mathematics and real world applications. In this project, we study the underlying mathematical processes at work in the instrument. This includes electromagnetic theory as well as Fourier and wave analysis. We use the work done to explain many of the observed phenomena of the electric guitar and construct a framework to model the output of the instrument. This process is heavily aided by implementing the mathematics into the Python programming language. We finish by offering a modification to account for non-idealised factors.*

## Discovering PDEs with Deep Learning
This paper explores a class of algorithms which use machine learning techniques to find governing equations from a given dataset. A theoretical discussion of why machine learning techniques are applicable in PDE theory and Rational Neural Networks is also presented.
